Before filing an issue, please keep in mind that developer time is extremely limited.  
We are happy that you are excited to use this project :) but we do not have the time or
resources to help users with their programming or debugging questions.  
Please read all of this before you delete it and type your bug if it is still appropriate.
For reference over 90% of the issues that were mass closed in 2025/11 did not qualify as bugs,
please help us help you by leaving more time for development.

If you have a problem, make sure that
1) you read the entire top level README
2) look at all the sub-pages: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix?tab=readme-ov-file#sub-pages
3) if you are using example code, you should be able to read and understand that code

If you need further help, you can ask on discourse:
https://rpi-rgb-led-matrix.discourse.group/  
Please understand again that no one is getting paid to help you. Help us help you:
- say what you have
- say what you tried
- if your panel isn't working, you need to read the markings on the chips
- search discourse and the bug tracker for your chip type if it's a chip issue or your issue type
("half my lines are black").
- generally please treat people's time as more valuable than yours, do as much as you can. There are
many of you and only one of them :)

For panel support issues, you want to refer to https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/blob/master/README.md#panels-supported .
The bugs working on chip support are for development, not "I bought this panel and I want you to make it work"
(it is on you to research which panels are supported before you buy).  
If you have a commercial application where you need support for a new panel and are 
willing to pay consulting rates for that work, then it is ok to state so in the panel 
support bug and someone may be able to work something out with you, but again be mindful 
this is not a commercial or paid project.

It is of course always ok to suggest a new feature that is different from supporting new
panels.

A few master bugs that may help:
- Pi5 support: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/1603
- PWM panel support: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/466
- HUB320: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/1618
- Python bindings: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/1749
- C# bindings: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/1828

For language bindings, note that the main developers are not using them, so they will lag.
Your patience is appreciated, and help is welcome :)

Once you have read all this, if you still have a bug to file, you can delete this text and go ahead.
