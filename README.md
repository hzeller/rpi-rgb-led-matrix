Controlling RGB LED display with Raspberry Pi GPIO
==================================================

A library to control commonly available 32x32 or 16x32 RGB LED panels with the
Raspberry Pi. Can support PWM up to 11Bit per channel, providing true 24bpp
color with CIE1931 profile (but: see Limitations below).

The LED-matrix library is (c) Henner Zeller <h.zeller@acm.org> with
GNU General Public License Version 2.0 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt>

The example code using this library is released in the public domain.

## [PSA: the pinout changed on 2015-07-19 to provide more glitch-free output. If you have an existing wiring, provide -DRGB_CLASSIC_PINOUT to the compilation; better yet, consider changing the wiring as it provides a much more stable image.]

Overview
--------
The 32x32 or 16x32 RGB LED matrix panels can be scored at [Sparkfun][sparkfun],
[AdaFruit][ada] or eBay. If you are in China, I'd try to get them directly
from some manufacturer, Taobao or Alibaba.

The `RGBMatrix` class provided in `include/led-matrix.h` does what is needed
to control these. You can use this as a library in your own projects or just
use the demo binary provided here which provides some useful examples.

Check out the [minimal-example.cc](./minimal-example.cc) to get started using
this library.

All Raspberry Pi versions supported
-----------------------------------

This supports the old Raspberry Pi's Version 1 with 26 GPIO pins and also the newer B+ models,
and Raspberry Pi 2 with 40 GPIO pins.
The 26 GPIO models can drive one chain of RGB panels, the 40 pin GPIO models **up to three** chains
in parallel (each chain 6-8 panels long).

The Raspberry Pi 2 is faster than older models and sometimes the cabeling can't keep up with the
speed; check out this [troubleshooting section](#help-some-pixels-are-not-displayed-properly)
what to do.

It is recommended to install an image with a realtime kernel (for instance [this one][emlid-rt])
to minimize a loaded system having an influence on the image quality.

Connection
----------
You need a separate power supply for the panel. There is a connector for that
separate from the logic connector, typically a big one in the center of the
board. The board requires 5V (double check the polarity: what is printed
on the board is correct - I once got boards with supplied cables that had red
(suggesting `+`) and black (suggesting `GND`) reversed!). This power supply is
used to light the LEDs; plan for ~3.5 Ampere per 32x32 panel.

The connector on the RGB panels is called a Hub75 interface. Each panel typically has two
ports, one is the input and the other is the output to chain additional panels. Usually an
arrow shows which of the connectors is the input.

Here you see a Hub75 connector to be seen at the bottom of the RGB panel board including
the arrow indicating the input direction:
![Hub 75 interface][hub75-arrow]

Other boards are very similar, but instead of zero-indexed color bits
`R0`, `G0`, `B0`, `R1`, `G1`, `B1`, they start the index with one and name these
`R1`, `G1`, `B1`, `R2`, `G2`, `B2`; the functionality is identical.
![Hub 75 interface][hub75]

Throughout this document, we will use the one-index base, so we will call these signals
`R1`, `G1`, `B1`, `R2`, `G2`, `B2` below.

If you plug an IDC-cable into your RGB panel, this is how the signals are on the other end
of the cable (imagine the LED panels somewhere outside the picture on the left); note the notch
on the right side of the connector:
![Hub 75 IDC connector][hub75-idc]

The RPi only has 3.3V logic output level, but the display operated at 5V interprets
these logic levels fine, just make sure to run a very short cable to the board.
If you do run into glitches or erratic pixels, consider some line-buffering,
e.g. using the [active adapter PCB](./adapter/).
Since we only need output pins on the RPi, we don't need to worry about level
conversion back.

For a single chain of LED-panels, we need 13 IO pins, which fit all in the
header of the old Raspberry Pis. Newer Raspberry Pis have 40 GPIO pins which allows
us to connect three parallel chains of RGB panels.

For reference, this is how the numbering on the Raspberry Pi looks like:
<a href="img/raspberry-gpio.jpg"><img src="img/raspberry-gpio.jpg" width="600px"></a>

This is the same representation as in the table below, which allows nice visual inspection.

### Wiring diagram

For each of the up to three chains, you have to connect `GND`, `strobe`,
`clock`, `OE-`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` to all of these; you find the positions
below (note there are more GND pins on the Raspberry Pi, but for simplicity
(we only need one), they are left out).

Then for each panel, there is a set of (R1, G1, B1, R2, G2, B2) that you have
to connect to the corresponding pins that are marked `[1]`, `[2]` and `[3]` for
chain 1, 2, and 3 below.
To make things quicker to see visually, I've marked each chain with a separate
icon `[1]`=:smile:, `[2]`=:boom: and `[3]`=:droplet:; signals that go to all chains
are marked with all icons.

In the [adapter/](./adapter) directory, there are some boards that make
the wiring task simpler.

Running
-------
The main.cc has some testing demos. Via command line flags, you can choose
the display type you have (16x32 or 32x32), and how many you have chained.
(Previous versions of this software required to do modifications in the source,
that is now all dynamically configurable).

     $ make
     $ ./led-matrix
     usage: ./led-matrix <options> -D <demo-nr> [optional parameter]
     Options:
         -r <rows>     : Display rows. 16 for 16x32, 32 for 32x32. Default: 32
         -P <parallel> : For Plus-models or RPi2: parallel chains. 1..3. Default: 1
         -c <chained>     : Daisy-chained boards. Default: 1.
         -L               : 'Large' display, composed out of 4 times 32x32
         -p <pwm-bits>    : Bits used for PWM. Something between 1..11
         -l               : Don't do luminance correction (CIE1931)
         -D <demo-nr>     : Always needs to be set
         -d               : run as daemon. Use this when starting in
                            /etc/init.d, but also when running without
                            terminal (e.g. cron).
         -t <seconds>     : Run for these number of seconds, then exit.
                            (if neither -d nor -t are supplied, waits for <RETURN>)
         -b <brightness>  : Sets brightness percent. Default: 100.
     Demos, choosen with -D
         0  - some rotating square
         1  - forward scrolling an image (-m <scroll-ms>)
         2  - backward scrolling an image (-m <scroll-ms>)
         3  - test image: a square
         4  - Pulsing color
         5  - Grayscale Block
         6  - Abelian sandpile model (-m <time-step-ms>)
         7  - Conway's game of life (-m <time-step-ms>)
         8  - Langton's ant (-m <time-step-ms>)
         9  - Volume bars (-m <time-step-ms>)
         10 - Evolution of color (-m <time-step-ms>)
         11 - Brightness pulse generator
     Example:
         ./led-matrix -t 10 -D 1 runtext.ppm
     Scrolls the runtext for 10 seconds

To run the actual demos, you need to run this as root so that the
GPIO pins can be accessed.

The most interesting one is probably the demo '1' which requires a ppm (type
raw) with a height of 32 pixel - it is infinitely scrolled over the screen; for
convenience, there is a little runtext.ppm example included:

     $ sudo ./led-matrix -D 1 runtext.ppm

Here is a video of how it looks
[![Runtext][run-vid]](http://youtu.be/OJvEWyvO4ro)

There are also two examples [minimal-example.cc](./minimal-example.c) and
[text-example.cc](./text-example.cc) that show use of the API.

The text example allows for some interactive output of text (using a bitmap-font
found in the `fonts/` directory). Even though it is just an example, it can
be useful in its own right. For instance, you can connect to its input with a
pipe and simply feed text from a shell-script or other program that wants to
output something. Let's display the time in blue:

     (while :; do date +%T ; sleep 0.2 ; done) | sudo ./text-example -f fonts/8x13B.bdf -y8 -c2 -C0,0,255

You could connect this via a pipe to any process that just outputs new
information on standard-output every now and then. The screen is filled with
text until it overflows which then clears it. Or sending an empty line explicitly
clears the screen (if you want to display an empty line, just send a space).

![Time][time]


### Image Viewer ###

One of the possibly useful demo applications is an image viewer that
reads all kinds of image formats, including animated gifs. It is not compiled
by default, as you need to install the GraphicsMagick dependencies first:

     sudo aptitude install libgraphicsmagick++1-dev
     make led-image-viewer

Then, you can run it with any common image format:

    sudo ./led-image-viewer myimage.gif

It also supports the standard options to specify the connected
displays (`-r`, `-c`, `-P`).

Chaining, parallel chains and coordinate system
------------------------------------------------

Displays also have an output port, that you can connect to the next display
in a daisy-chain manner. There is a parameter in the demo program to give
number of displays that are chained. You end up with a very wide
display (chain * 32 pixels). Longer chains affect the refresh rate negatively,
so if you want to stay above 100Hz with full color, don't chain more than
8 panels.
If you use a PWM depth of 1 bit, the chain can be much longer.

The original Raspberry Pis with 26 GPIO pins just had enough connector pins
to drive one chain of LED panels. Newer Raspberry Pis have 40 GPIO pins that
allows to add two additional chains of panels in parallel - the nice thing is,
that this doesn't require more CPU and allows you to keep your refresh-rate high,
because you can shorten your chains.

So with that, we have a couple of parameters to keep track of. The **rows** are
the number of LED rows on a particular module; typically these are 16 for a 16x32
display or 32 for 32x32 displays.

Then there is the **chain length**, which is the number of panels that are
daisy chained together.

Finally, there is a parameter how many **parallel** chains we have connected to
the Pi -- limited to 1 on old Raspberry Pis, up to three on newer Raspberry Pis.

For a single Panel, the chain and parallel parameters are both just one: a single
chain (with no else in parallel) with a chain length of 1.

The `RGBMatrix` class constructor has parameters for number of rows,
chain-length and number of parallel. For the demo programs, there are
command line options for that: `-r` gives rows, `-c` the chain-length and
`-P` the number of parallel chains.

The coordinate system starts at (0,0) at the top of the first parallel chain,
furthest away from the Pi. The following picture gives an overview of various
parameters and the coordinate system.

![Coordinate overview][coordinates]

<a href="adapter/"><img src="img/three-parallel-panels-soic.jpg" width="300px"></a>

## Remapping coordinates ##
You can as well chain multiple boards together and then arrange them in a
different layout. Say you have 4 displays with 32x32 -- if we chain
them, we get a display 32 pixel high, (4*32)=128 pixel long. If we arrange
the boards in a square, we get a logical display of 64x64 pixels.

For convenience, we should only deal with the logical coordinates of
64x64 pixels in our program: implement a `Canvas`
interface to do the coordinate mapping. Have a look at
`class LargeSquare64x64Canvas` for an example and see how it is delegating to
the underlying RGBMatrix with changed coordinates.

Here is how the wiring would look like:

Using the API
-------------
While there is a demo program, the matrix code can be used independently as
a library. The includes are in `include/`, the library to link is built
in `lib/`. So if you are proficient in C++, then use it in your code.

Due to the wonders of github, it is pretty easy to be up-to-date.
I suggest to add this code as a sub-module in your git repository. That way
you can use that particular version and easily update it if there are changes:

     git submodule add https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.git matrix

(Read more about how to use [submodules in git][git-submodules])

This will check out the repository in a subdirectory `matrix/`.
The library to build would be in directory `matrix/lib`, so let's hook that
into your toplevel Makefile.
I suggest to set up some variables like this:

     RGB_INCDIR=matrix/include
     RGB_LIBDIR=matrix/lib
     RGB_LIBRARY_NAME=rgbmatrix
     RGB_LIBRARY=$(RGB_LIBDIR)/lib$(RGB_LIBRARY_NAME).a
     LDFLAGS+=-L$(RGB_LIBDIR) -l$(RGB_LIBRARY_NAME) -lrt -lm -lpthread

Also, you want to add a target to build the libary in your sub-module

	 # (FYI: Make sure, there is a TAB-character in front of the $(MAKE))
     $(RGB_LIBRARY):
		 $(MAKE) -C $(RGB_LIBDIR)

Now, your final binary needs to depend on your objects and also the
`$(RGB_LIBRARY)`

     my-binary : $(OBJECTS) $(RGB_LIBRARY)
	     $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@ $(LDFLAGS)

As an example, see the [PixelPusher implementation][pixelpush] which is using
this library in a git sub-module.

If you are writing your own Makefile, make sure to pass the `-O3` option to
the compiler to make sure to generate fast code.

Note, all the types provided are in the `rgb_matrix` namespace. That way, they
won't clash with other types you might use in your code; in particular pretty
common names such as `GPIO` or `Canvas` might run into clashing trouble.

Anyway, for convenience you just might add using-declarations in your
code:

     // Types exported by the RGB-Matrix library.
     using rgb_matrix::Canvas;
     using rgb_matrix::GPIO;
     using rgb_matrix::RGBMatrix;
     using rgb_matrix::ThreadedCanvasManipulator;

Or, if you are lazy, just import the whole namespace:

     using namespace rgb_matrix;

Read the [`minimal-example.cc`](./minimal-example.cc) to get started, then
have a look into [`demo-main.cc`](./demo-main.cc).

Help, some pixels are not displayed properly
--------------------------------------------
Some panels don't handle the 3.3V logic level well, in particular with
faster Raspberry Pis Version 2. This results in artifacts like randomly
showing up pixels or parts of the panel showing 'static'.

If you encounter this, try these things

   - Make sure to have as short as possible flat-cables connecting your
     Raspberry Pi with the LED panel.

   - Use an adapter board with a bus-driver that acts as level shifter between
     3.3V and 5V. You can find [active adapter PCBs](./adapter/) in a
     subdirectory of this project.

   - If you can't implement the above things, or still have problems, you can
     slow down the GPIO writing a bit. This will of course reduce the
     frame-rate, so it comes at a cost.

For GPIO slow-down, uncomment the following line in [lib/Makefile](lib/Makefile)

     #DEFINES+=-DRGB_SLOWDOWN_GPIO   # remove '#' in the beginning

Then `make clean` and `make` again.

Inverted Colors ?
-----------------
There are some displays out there that use inverse logic for the colors. You
notice that your image looks like a 'negative'. In that case, uncomment the
folling `DEFINES` line in [lib/Makefile](./lib/Makefile) by removing the `#`
at the beginning of the line.

     #DEFINES+=-DINVERSE_RGB_DISPLAY_COLORS   # remove '#' in the beginning

Then, recompile

     make clean
     make

A word about power
------------------

These displays suck a lot of current. At 5V, when all LEDs are on (full white),
my LED panel draws about 3.4A. That means, you need a beefy power supply to
drive these panels; a 2A USB charger or similar is not enough for a
32x32 panel; it might be for a 16x32.

If you connect multiple boards together, you needs a power supply that can
keep up with 3.5A / panel. Good are PC power supplies that often provide > 20A
on the 5V rail. Also you can get dedicated 5V high current switching power
supplies for these kind of applications (check eBay).

The current draw is pretty spiky. Due to the PWM of the LEDs, there are very
short peaks of a couple of 100ns to about 1ms of full current draw.
Often, the power cable can't support these very short spikes due to inherent
inductance. This can result in 'noisy' outputs, with random pixels not behaving
as they should. A low ESR capacitor close to the input is good in these cases.

On some displays, the quality of the output quickly gets erratic
when voltage drops below 4.5V. Some even need a little bit higher voltage around
5.5V to work reliably.

When you connect these boards to a power source, the following are good
guidelines:
   - Have fairly thick cables connecting the power to the board.
     Plan not to loose more than 50mV from the source to the LED matrix.
     So that would be 50mV / 3.5A = 14 mΩ. For both supply wires, so 7mΩ
     each trace.
     A 1mm² copper cable has about 17.5mΩ/meter, so you'd need a **2.5mm²
     copper cable per meter and panel**. Multiply by meter and number of
     panels to get the needed cross-section.
     (For Americans: that would be ~13 gauge wire for 3 ft and one panel)

   - You might consider using aluminum mounting brackets or bars as part of
     your power trace solution. With aluminum of 1mm² specific resistivity of
     about 28mΩ/meter, you'd need a cross sectional area of about 4mm² per panel
     and meter.

   - These are the minimum values to not drop more than 50mV. As engineer, you'd
     like to aim for less than that :)

   - Often these boards come with connectors that have cables crimped on.
     These cables are typically too thin; you might want to clip them close to
     the connector solder your proper, thick cable to it.

   - It is good to buffer the current spikes directly at the panel. The most
     spikes happen while PWM-ing a single line.
     So let's say we want to buffer the energy to power a single line without
     dropping more than 50mV. We use 3.5A which is 3.5Joule/second. We do
     about 140Hz refresh rate and divide that in 16 lines, so we need
     3.5 Joule/140/16 = ~1.6mJoule in the time period to display one line.
     We want to get the energy out of the voltage drop of 50mV; so with
     W = 1/2*C*U², we can calculate the capacitance needed:
       C = 2 * 1.6mJoule / ((5V)² - (5V - 50mV)²) = ~6400µF.
     So, **2 x 3300µF** low-ESR capacitors in parallel directly
     at the board are a good choice (two, because lower parallel ESR; also
     fits easier under board).
     (In reality, we need of course less, as the highest ripple comes with
      50% duty cyle thus half the current; also the input is recharching all
      the time. But: as engineer plan for maximum and then some).

   - If you still see noise, increase the voltage sligthly above 5V. But note,
     this is typically only a symptom of too thin traces.

Technical details
-----------------

The matrix modules available on the market all seem to have the same
standard interface, essentially controlling
two banks of 16 rows (0..15 and 16..31) There are always two rows (n and n+16),
that are controlled in parallel
(These displays are also available in 16x32; in that case, it is two banks of 8).

The data for each row needs to be clocked in serially using one bit for red,
green and blue for both rows that are controlled in parallel (= 6 bits), then
a positive clock edge to shift them in - 32 pixels for one row are clocked in
like this (or more: you can chain these displays).
With 'strobe', the data is transferred to the output buffers for the row.
There are four bits that select the current row(-pair) to be displayed.
Also, there is an 'output enable' which switches if LEDs are on at all.

Since LEDs can only be on or off, we have to do our own PWM by constantly
clocking in pixels.

**CPU use**

These displays need to be updated constantly to show an image with PWMed
LEDs. For one 32x32 display, every second about 500'000 pixels have to be
updated. We can't use any hardware support to do that - thus the constant
CPU use on an RPi is roughly 30%. Keep that in mind if you plan to run other
things on this computer (This is less noticable on Raspberry Pi, Version 2).

Also, the output quality is suceptible to other heavy tasks running on that
computer as the precise timing needed might be slipping. Even if the system is
otherwise idle, you might see occasional brightness variations in the darker
areas of your picture.
(Even with realtime extensions enabled in Linux, this is still a (smaller)
problem).

The timing of the Output Enable pin has to be very accurate otherwise you'll
see brightness glitches. We are using the PWM hardware of the Raspberry Pi to
provide such accurate timing.

Limitations
-----------
If you are using the RGB_CLASSIC_PINOUT, then we can't make use of the PWM
hardware (which only outputs to a particular pin), so you'll see random
brightness glitches. I strongly suggest to change to the now
default pinout.

The system needs constant CPU to update the display. Using the DMA controller
was considered but after extensive experiments ( https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo )
dropped due to its slow speed..

There seems to be a limit in how fast the GPIO pins can be controlled, which
limits the frame-rate.
