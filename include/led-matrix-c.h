 * Universal way to create and initialize a matrix.

 * flags provided, that then can override any of the defaults given.
 * The arguments that have been used from the command line are removed from
 * the argv list (and argc is adjusted) - that way these don't mess with your
 * own command line handling.
 *
 * The actual options used are filled back into the "options" struct if not
 * NULL.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ----------------
 * int main(int argc, char **argv) {
 *   struct RGBLedMatrixOptions options;
 *   memset(&options, 0, sizeof(options));
 *   options.rows = 32;            // You can set defaults if you want.
 *   options.chain_length = 1;

 *   if (matrix == NULL) {
