# Uncomment to allow to use up to three parallel boards.
# This will only work on the plus models or RPi2 with 40 GPIO pins.
#
# This is useful in any case, _unless_ you have an older installation with
# classic cabeling of previous versions of this library or a
# Raspberry Pi 1, Revision 1 (very old).
#
# The reason why this is disabled by default is that it is not compatible with
# GPIO cabelings of previous versions of this software and thus is already
# wired up 'in the field'. Also it will drop support for the very first
# Raspberry Pi, Revision 1.
# Hence we leave this off for now for the least amount of surprise.
# If you connect 3 chains in parallel, switch this on. The default
# will work up to 2 chains just fine, but you won't be able to use IÂ²C.

# If you see that your display is inverse, you might have a matrix variant
# has uses inverse logic for the RGB bits. In that case: uncomment this.
