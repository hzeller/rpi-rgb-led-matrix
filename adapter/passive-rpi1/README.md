Adapter PCB to connect to Rasbperry Pi1
=======================================

   * Passive board. Simple, but might need to define `--led-slowdown-gpio` if you see
     glitches.
   * Supports one panel connected to a 26 pin Raspberry Pi 1. If you have a newer RPi,
     check out the [Passive 3](../passive-3) or [Active 3](../active-3) adapter.
   * Open source KiCAD PCB EDA format.
   * (not very pretty layout, was just lazy and let the auto-router do it).
   * The FAB files are provided as [passive-rpi-hub75-adapter-fab.zip](./passive-rpi-hub75-adapter-fab.zip)
