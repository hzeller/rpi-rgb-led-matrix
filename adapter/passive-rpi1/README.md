Adapter PCB to connect to Rasbperry Pi1
=======================================

   * Passive board. Simple, but might need to define `RGB_SLOWDOWN_GPIO` if you see
     glitches.
   * Supports one panel connected to a 26 pin Raspberry Pi 1. If you have a newer RPi,
     check out the [Passive 3](../passive3) or [Active 3](../active-3) adapter.
   * Open source KiCAD PCB EDA format.
   * (not very pretty layout, was just lazy and let the auto-router do it).

You can [buy the board from OSH Park][osh-passive-rpi].
