Adapter PCB to support up to 3 panels
======================================

   * Passive board. Simple, but might need to define `RGB_SLOWDOWN_GPIO` if you see
     glitches. Consider using the [active board](../active-3) in that case.
   * Supports up to three panel chains for newer plus models and
     Raspberry Pi 2 that have 40 GPIO pins.
   * Open source KiCAD PCB EDA format.
   * (not very pretty layout, was just lazy and let the auto-router do it).

You can [buy the board from OSH Park][osh-passive3].
