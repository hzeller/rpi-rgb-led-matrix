Adapter PCB to support up to 3 panels
======================================

   * Supports up to three panel chains for newer plus models and
     Raspberry Pi 2 that have 40 GPIO pins.
   * Open source KiCAD PCB EDA format.
   * (not very pretty layout, was just lazy and let the auto-router do it).
     
You can [buy the board from OSH Park][osh-passive3].
